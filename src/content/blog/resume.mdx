Development:
<ul>
	<li>
		Data Mining Search – Data mining web application designed to facilitate search and retrieval of
		NW Flight Test data meeting specific criteria (nodeJS/Typescript/Python). Metadata stored in
		Postgres, time series data stored in InfluxDB. Built on RESTful web services and deployed to
		Kubernetes on hybrid cluster using AWS VMs and lab servers. Currently in production serving
		flight test analysts and engineers. Unit testing with jest (nodeJS), pytest (Python)
	</li>
	<li>
		Automated Frequency Analysis Tool – Led a team of junior engineers to develop a Python-based
		Jupyter notebook designed to automate signal frequency analysis and highlight anomalous behavior
		and classify the likelihood of failure.
	</li>
	<li>
		Anomalous Signal Detection – Guided a team of engineers to develop a tool to look for anomalous
		signal behavior using Keras, a deep learning API for implementing neural networks.
	</li>
	<li>
		Aircraft Configuration System - Led team of engineers to create API to allow developers to
		request critical aircraft configuration information from Oracle database.
	</li>
</ul>
DevOps:
<ul>
	<li>
		Ansible - Created scripts to automate and standardize the provisioning of packages, firewall
		rules, and user privileges on new servers
	</li>
	<li>Git/Gitlab - CI/CD scripts to run tests, code security analysis, deployment to Kubernetes</li>
	<li>
		Splunk - designed dashboards and alerts using Splunk QL to automate notifications to response
		teams and provide situational awareness
	</li>
</ul>
Linux Administration:
<ul>
	<li>
		Created Azure RHEL VMs equipped with all required development tools to standardize the team's
		environment and rapidly onboard new members.
	</li>
	<li>Streamlined user management access using Boeing Enterprise netgroups.</li>
	<li>Deployed, and configured nginx as a reverse proxy</li>
	<li>Bash scripting and cron jobs automate resource monitoring and cleanup.</li>
	<li>
		Server certificate management - create, revoke, and deploy server certificates to secure service
		communication
	</li>
	<li>
		Database backup, dump, restore - migrating databases (Postgres, MySQL) and associated services
	</li>
	<li>Group management using Active Directory LDAP, and UNIX netgroups</li>
</ul>
Azure Administration:
<ul>
	<li>Created/managed Azure RHEL VMs, Azure Event Hub, and Azure Blob storage.</li>
</ul>
Cloud/container services:
<ul>
	<li>Keycloak Identity and Access Management service deployed on Kubernetes</li>
	<li>Argo workflow manager deployed on Kubernetes</li>
	<li>Microservices deployed on Kubernetes</li>
	<li>Docker swarm deployed to manage service stack running on docker network</li>
	<li>
		BigQuery Proof-of-concept to test viability as a time-series database to replace lab hosted
		Influx DB.
	</li>
</ul>
Data pipeline:
<ul>
	<li>
		Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) flight test data and metadata into Postgres relational database
		and InfluxDB time-series database to facilitate custom queries to isolate data of interest.
	</li>
</ul>

Development:
<ul>
	<li>
		Trajectory Calculation/Prediction (Java): Optimal trajectory calculation to optimize fuel
		savings. Verified with actual FMC hardware in IASL by entering calculated waypoints and flight
		parameters in FMC to verify calculated trajectory expectations.
	</li>
	<li>
		Wind Updates/Route Sync (Java): Automated retrieval of NOAA weather models for memory-based
		weather cache. This cache rapidly updates flight path calculations and suggests re-routes for
		fuel savings.
	</li>
	<li>
		Cockpit messaging – (Java): Developed ground-based ATC tools to send CPDLC messages over
		FANS-1/A and ATN networks. Involved various ARINC protocols (429, 629, 664).
	</li>
	<li>
		Collaborative Situational Awareness (Java): Interagency information exchange using AIXM to
		define airspace corridors and areas of interest. Messaging exchanged via (JMS, ActiveMQ, and IBM
		MQ) with partners (MIT Lincoln Labs, Embry-Riddle, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, ICAO).
		Microservices deployed on Tomcat/IBM Web Sphere.
	</li>
	<li>
		Cockpit Configurable Graphics Display: NodeJS/HTML5 application running on iPhone using
		web-socket/TCP bridge developed to communicate with cockpit EFB (electronic flight bag).
		Provided speed guidance to the pilot to meet interval spacing requirements.

	<li>
		Secure Container Tracking (HTML/PHP): Visual display of shipping container locations for
		situational awareness, deployed on Apache web server
	</li>
</ul>
DevOps:
<ul>
	<li>Jenkins - CI/CD configuration to run tests, and deploy to lab-managed servers.</li>
